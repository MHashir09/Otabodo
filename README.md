# Otabōdo

A dashboard interface built as part of The Odin Project's Intermediate HTML and CSS course. This project demonstrates modern CSS layout techniques and design implementation skills.

The idea of this dashboard is to have a dashboard for your favorite anime/web-series and movies alike, like keeping track of them and getting latest updates about them. The name of this dashboard is a combination of two japanese words "Otaku"( sort of like a nerd ) and "Bodo"( board ).

This is a just a design to practice grid layout and other css properties and is not functional except theme switching. Its not that responsive either, just made it for practice. I may turn this into a full fledge dashboard oneday.
